# VersionOne Linkify Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension searches the pages you browse for VersionOne issue identifiers (for instance, "D-12345") and turns those IDs into clickable links to your instance of VersionOne.

The extension is still in the alpha phase; feedback/contributions welcome. See the Issues tab for known problems and planned features.
